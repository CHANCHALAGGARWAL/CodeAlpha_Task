This repository contains two Python-based mini projects.

1. 🎮 Hangman Game
2. 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot

 
1.🎮 CodeAlpha - Hangman Game

This is a simple text-based Python game created.  
The game challenges the player to guess a hidden word within limited attempts.

---

 📄 Project Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game.  
A word is randomly selected from a list, and the user must guess it one letter at a time.  
The game ends when the word is guessed or the user runs out of allowed attempts.

---

 🚀 Features
- Random word selection
- Displays guessed and remaining letters
- Limits incorrect attempts to 6
- Console-based interaction
- End message on win/loss

---

🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- `random` module
- `while` loops
- String and list operations

---

▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone the repository or download `hangman.py`
3. Open terminal and navigate to the folder
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py

2.🤖 CodeAlpha - Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple **text-based chatbot**.  
The chatbot interacts with users based on predefined responses using basic Python logic.

---

📘 Project Overview

This chatbot responds to user input like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, or `"bye"` using a simple set of conditions.  
It runs in the terminal and provides basic conversation flow without needing any external library.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Rule-based logic using `if-elif-else`
- Accepts real-time input from the user
- Predefined conversational responses
- Exits gracefully when user types `"bye"`
- Fun emoji-based interaction

---

🧠 Python Concepts Used
- Conditional Statements
- Infinite `while` loop
- String handling (`lower()`)
- Function definition
- Console Input/Output

---

▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the `chatbot.py` file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
5. Run the chatbot using:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
